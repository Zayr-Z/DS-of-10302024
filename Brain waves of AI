#Beginning stage of AI
Humans are trying to create a another type of human intelligent. Is it possible?. Yes, beginning of the formation of human intelligent, most important factor is brain. From birth of a child the brain are developing time to time by experience, moments etc. In deep sence of brain format new neurons are forming and that neurons are developing by time but actually its not time, its from experience. For example, look at a child he is just curious and not aware of lot of things, he just exploring things. Child show a curiousity touch the fire parent told dont touch, but he touch it and felt the pain, here the brain produce a new neruon...Dont ever touch the fire its painful. Human intelligent or AI also based with neurons and this example
